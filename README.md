### Problem Statement 

Reddit is a social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website that features over 11,400 different "sub-Reddits" or content groups. Users are able to add or interact with content called "posts" (which are titled, contain a main body of either text or media attachments, etc.) through comments and voting up/down. But what if a bug in the system or simple human error ends up corrupting sub-Reddit tags? Then the tedious responsibility of fixing it befalls someone to read, understand, and classify the posts. However, content across sub-Reddits are not necessarily disjoint. This makes it difficult to simply glance and guess which sub-Reddit a given post belongs to.

When Phaedrus famously said *"Things are not always what they seem; the first appearance deceives many; the intelligence of a few perceives what has been carefully hidden"*, surely he didn't mean artificial intelligence. Yet those words of wisdom ring true in this data-driven age - perhaps more so now than ever, which leads us to our problem: **How accurately can we use machine learning to classify similar content from two different sources?**

I couldn't choose one post because I didn't have the time to read and follow each one so I have linked them all below. Please make sure you give these posts some love! Reddit gold would be awesome.

t3_m8921l,RH to blame: so u r wondering where stimny? where lambo??? here is why stimmy didnt putdoge on the moon - u dumped it all into RH,"here is the issue - most of u dumped stimmy into RH

RH does not always source doge from open markets or exchanges. they source doge from their own pools or dark pools.. some say they actually pretend to hold any doge for u while betting  against u.. that u will cash out at a loss and they keep the diff as profit.. in any case the money u put in RH had no bearing on the overrall markets .. u just bought some doge from RH.. u didnt even buy it.. u bought a claim to doge RH owns in their wallet.. so all the stimmy has Vladimir Tenev the CEO of RH laughing all the way to the bank..

if u want stimmy to hit u need to put your money into an actual wallet thru coinflip or voyager or binance.. anything that actually provides ownership of doge thru keys.. new wallets is also an important metric in bull investment analysis.. the more wallets the better for crypto like doge

right now u just hold a promise to repay u at market prices when u cash out from robbin hood ..  the doge all in RH wallet or whatever fantasy portfolio they ""hold"" for u - they are the biggest whale to dismantle 

help take doge to friggin andromeda by shifting at least some into real wallets so u can actually spend it too

watch doge rise",dogecoin

t3_m7yvjw,"Adopt a Dog, #AdoptaDogecoin","Hey [r](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)/dogecoin -- 

We're Finn -- a small company that makes dog vitamins and *really* loves dogs. We just launched #AdoptaDogecoin -- our mission is to send doggy adoptions to the moon 🚀!

TLDR:

* We bought 100k DOGE, and **we'll send anyone who adopts a shelter dog 500 DOGE.**
* We're accepting DOGE payments on our site, and donating 100% of profits paid in DOGE directly to shelters.
* We'd love your help spreading the word.

**Why are we doing this?** We thought this could be a really neat way to find lots of loving homes for lots of loving dogs. Dogecoin and the DOGE community are much special. We like using the internet for good thing.

**How's it work?** We'll send anyone who adopts a shelter dog 500 DOGE. Just send us a photo of your new best friend, your adoption certificate, and your wallet address.

**How can you help?** Well, lots of ways:

* Adopt a dog! That's the ultimate goal, after all. Let us know once you do.
* If you're a shelter (or you know of one) who would like to get involved, let's connect. We'd like to enroll as many shelters as possible.
* Help spread the word: We've created lots of [fun memes](https://adoptadogecoin.org/) that you can share around. Send us some Twitter love and spread the word; you know the deal. The #DogeArmy is strong.
* Get involved; we could use the help! We're a small team with a big idea. If you see an opportunity to add value or help out in any way, please reach out -- we'd love to have you onboard -- really.

**Get in touch:** We're here, ask us anything. You can also find us at:

t3_m7s7nv,Earn Dogecoin while helping Vertcoin's network grow,"My goal with this post is not to shill Vertcoin rather I am asking for help to my fellow crypto community.

Vertcoin is an ASIC resistant Bitcoin variant whose sole purpose is to give everyday users a chance at earning Vertcoin with their GPUs. They have forked to a new mining algorithm three times so far to kick ASICS off their network.

Their recent fork to Verthash which happen few months ago lets you mine Vertcoin with a GPU that has at least 2 GB of VRAM. They also recently released an open source software called One Click Miner, which makes it very easy to get started with mining Vertcoin in no time.

One of our volunteer developer who loves dogecoin forked the One Click Miner and made it so that you can get paid in Dogecoin while mining Vertcoin and help secure its network. This isn't some cloud mining scheme or a closed source miner that charges hefty fee. The code is open source and if you have any concerns about it, you can take a look and decide for yourself if it is safe for you to use.

Here is the link: [https://github.com/vertiond/verthash-one-click-miner/releases/latest](https://github.com/vertiond/verthash-one-click-miner/releases/latest)

Note: If you decide to download it and give it a try, your AV software or Windows defender might warn you about there being a virus in the miner. It is a false positive and all mining software are flagged as virus. Just add it to the exclusion list and you are all set.

I hope we can work together and benefit form it.

TL;DR:

If you want to earn Dogecoin and help secure Vertcoin's network, download the one click miner that is linked above.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:

Since the feed back to this post has been very positive I would like to add few more things that I missed before:

1. Updated download link to the latest release
2. If the miner keeps shutting down, along with the exe file also put %appdata%\\verthash-ocm on your AV or Windows defender exclude list.
3. This miner mines on zergpool and they have a higher payout threshold which means DOGE payouts are made automatically every 4 hours for all balances above **400**, or **80** on Sunday.
4. If you have any questions you would like to get addressed quickly please join our discord server. Members there are very helpful and you will also find the dev who worked on this there.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2:

Doge community and the mods of this subreddit are the best.

just wanted to know if you hodl´ers have your coins in an external wallet or on the plaforms you bought them? As far as i know, but correct me if wrong, the less coins are on the platforms the more the doge takes off?  
Simply spoken if you hodl and stay put, it would be the best to use an external wallet like Trust(Software) or Trezor(Hardware). Both are just an example.

Is this correct so far?

You will get other coins for reading articles, for listening to podcasts etc. I believe recycling will be tokenised, even fitness will. You will receive different tokens for every activity, so there will be a clear incentive for everything. Now for example, recycling is optional I. Many countries and most people don't want to loose time for something without immediate benefit. 
AI is coming, as well as universal income. Our jobs will become part time, and we will gain extra income from other incentives, as well as the universal income.

I believe DOGE will be the coin for the universal income. It has all that it needs for this, and even inflation is a good thing for extra scaling. All other crypto will exist, and you will have a very simple exchange to trade your activities. This is a good thing, because not everything can be scaled and traded in one currency. What I mean is that if everything I mentioned earlier used one coin, that would be a problem for calibrating the rewards depending on the factors determining that activity. But by having a special ecosystem for the activity, it's easier to calibrate rewards and payments depending on other factors.",dogecoin

t3_m84l1w,🐕 Onetail.org Doge for Dogs Donation!,"HELLO FELLOW SHIBES

There have been countless posts about wanting to do another positive publicity/donation stunt, yet not much to tie it all together like in the past. So - I built a website. I’ve been holding Doge since 2013 (miner) and know all the good this community can do. Check it out at: www.dogedonate.com 

Votes are in - donating Doge to help dogs/shelters. After reaching out to a few select charities, Onetail.org was intrigued by our friendly crypto and agreed to make their very own Doge wallet! Fast forward 2 weeks of getting things buckled up, it’s now live. With this setup 100% of donations go directly to them, full transparency. They’re an amazing group helping to rescue thousands of dogs from being euthanized in county shelters, and so much more. They'd appreciate our help just as much as we can appreciate them. View the stickies for many methods on how to purchase/transfer dogecoins. 

.

So, let’s see what we can do! News sources would love to cover ""Dogecoin cryptocurrency raises $XYZ toward rescuing shelter dogs in Chicago"" - which would be great for our image/niche, while helping an awesome charity and countless shelter pups. This could be a huge spark for us right now and literally any amount counts. 

Holding is great, yet never be afraid to donate/tip/spend, **big publicity affects the value.** If you can’t donate, do help spread the word. Oh and of course I asked if they recall rescuing any Shibas, and if they have a photo. Here’s their response!

t3_m86871,IF YOU’RE SERIOUS ABOUT DONATING DOGE TO AN ANIMAL SHELTER HERE’S THE SHELTER - ONETAIL.ORG AND HERE’S THE STEPS TO DO IT.,"
First off,

Be sure to thank u/Dogepix for his efforts in setting this up. This is all his work. It took him weeks to set this up. If you are interested in helping organize and set this these kinds of things up he is a member of our discord. All of us in the discord are working on different projects to benefit Dogecoin community. This is his personal project. Message me and I will send it to you the discord link.

Here’s the link to his website which tracks the donations (the donations go to directly to onetail Chicago animal shelter personal wallet)

https://www.dogedonate.com

Here’s the link to his original post (read it in it’s entirety)

https://old.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/m84l1w/onetailorg_doge_for_dogs_donation

Here’s the animal shelter: onetail.org located in Chicago (be sure to follow them on Twitter (onetailatatime)) to see what your donation is going to. 

The reason why I am making this post is to help provide a step by step on how to donate if you’re new to cryptocurrency.

Step One: You must have a personal wallet - Robhinhood will not work. To get a wallet you can choose any wallet you want, but I personally use dogechain.info or Guarda - make sure to save and back up your wallet on paper (called a paper wallet) 

Step Two: Use an exchange that lets you transfer your coin out - binance, anchorUSD etc. 

Step Three: transfer from the exchange to your personal wallet

Step Four: Send from your personal wallet to onetail.orgs wallet.

Congratulations! You have officially completed your first cryptocurrency transfer. You are part of the future AND you donated to a good cause

Also - there’s no goal for this, but the previous highest donation was $50,000 USD Or approx 871,000 doge at current value. Let’s see if we can beat it 

I personally donated 10,000 Dogecoin.

Stay safe shibas :)",dogecoin

Say that the world has 100 billion DogeC with a market cap of 50 billion, each could would be worth 50 cents, right?
If they burned 80 billion coins, each coin would be worth 2.5$

The market cap is currently $9.5billion (AUD) 9.5B * 0.07487 (price of doge in AUD) = 711,265,000 coins currently in the world. If they took out 300,000,000 (as an example) each coin would be worth about 23 dollars. 

711,265,000 - 300,000,000 = 411,265,000.

9.5billion  ÷  411,265,000 = 23.0994

Doge will increase every year roughly along the 3% inflation mark that the USD should be at, maybe a little more as older wallets are lost. Outside of rampant speculation, Doge should never rise quickly. 

The best way to increase the value of your doge is to stop holding it and start using it. Spend it on goods and services... start accepting it as payment... and stop “buying” doge on RH, ffs. Get a real wallet, spend it, circulate it.

This is the way.",dogecoin

t3_m81pmi,PSA : Don't use Robin Hood for DOGE,"Casual reminder that DOGE you buy through Robin Hood stagnates the market and you don't technically own the crypto, nor does your purchase cause it to rise.

There are many free alternatives for buying DOGE that only charge very modest fees that will accept most currencies including other crypto.

Binance for example is an excellent platform for purchasing Doge and you can send your crypto straight to your official DOGE coin wallet.

Buying Doge through a source like binance directly effects the trade volume and demand of DOGE
(Each of your purchases directly increases the perceived demand for your crypto)

I highly recommend stepping away from apps like Robin Hood and using sources that benefit you as a currency holder.

Remember:

Doge is a currency, and should be used like one.

quote:
""circulation of doge is massive, it would never reach 1$""

#My personal bull case is:
Circulation of dollar is much more massive and inflation uncontrolled. And still it worth 1$.
Dogecoin yes, is inflationary...way less than dollar, as is supposed to be an healthy currency.

resisting is futile
Dogecoin will prevail. Countdown to the moon is ticking.
I'm afraid for bears that Doge short shorts limitied edition will be sold in Doge.

t3_m7qe5t,A lot of Dogecoin buyers AREN'T seeing the bigger picture.,"Yes, it is inevitable that $DOGE will reach $1, it's just bound to happen. The problem is that we have the quick money grab users that will pull out at any dip and OR wait until the coin to reach 8-10¢ to pull out the game and the good boy will drop in value AGAIN. 

The one dollar mark is incredibly crucial because once we reach $1, the coin will go viral like never before and bring in so many new buyers, but in exchange a LOT of people will pull out because that is their goal $1. It is bigger than that, way bigger. That's why holding the line is so damn crucial because it is the best way for the value of the coin to go up. If you want the coin to reach $5,$10,$50... You gotta hold. This game is a long one to victory, financial freedom, immense wealth, and a debt killer, not a short one.

Moral of the story is to buy dogecoin and logout of Robinhood and Coinbase.  Regret your actions later, forgot about the coin, but do NOT pull out.

I logged onto the app once or twice a week to see how it was doing, but never ended up purchasing anything else on that platform.
Thank god too, because I got an email yesterday saying I violated their terms of service and my account has been closed. Sure enough, if I try to log on it says there's no account associated with that email - my doge is just gone. I have no goddamn clue what they're talking about, like I said all I did was make a purchase and log on a few times, but they haven't answered my email.

t3_m87mud,Unpopular opinion. Bring on the downvotes,"Whenever I see a coin that I think might have long term potential, I do a few things before spending the time reading news articles and looking at charts. First , I go to the official site to see what they're about. Then I look at their social media presence. And finally I come here to read what current coin holders have to say about the coin. It takes about 10-15 minutes to do and I think its common practice for anyone that invests. Most coins tweet daily updates and have well put together websites. Doge? Tweets are begging for rt and a website that looks like it was put together in 15 minutes. Then I came to Reddit, and holy hell. Its as if the people here want the coin to be considered a meme. I only mention this bc it makes me wonder how many people this community has scared away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Communities like this will be the death of DOGE. I guarantee that a good portion of this subs 1.2m members currently own DOGE.  And judging by the posts on this sub that means a good portion of the current coin owners are probably new to investing. As if that isnt enough to scare people away, what makes it worse is that 51% of all the coins are owned by whales.

&amp;#x200B;

Being listed on CB will do almost nothing for the price (other than a short term spike) yet I constantly see posts about it on here. If someone is interested in DOGE, they'll find another way to get it. Anyone that has any knowledge of crypto has heard of DOGE by now. DOGE has barely moved in price ever since it went parabolic. Trade volume has steadily decreased. Its pretty obvious that people just aren't interested, and I don't blame them. Simply put, if DOGE is ever going to hit $1 it needs to be more commonly accepted by merchants. And before that happens it needs to lose its meme status. In the 3 months, what news/updates have we gotten? Nothing. So why is everyone focused on harassing the people at CB over a listing instead of the people that you invested in?  The people that made billions off of YOUR money. Lets be honest, Elons tweets are the only reason DOGE isnt back under .01, and that should concern anyone with money invested. 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr;

The coin itself has a lot of potential, but it needs to stop being a meme and rebrand before it will ever be taken seriously enough to reach $1.",dogecoin

t3_m80qsn,What to do with RH Doge purchased??,"Hello and first post,

I have about $1,600 worth of Doge that I purchased through RH, my entry point was not the greatest and I have been down ever since I purchased. But I firmly believe in DC and positive it will succeed and be a great crypto currency. I learned shortly after I had made several purchases of the drawbacks of using RH over a dedicated Crypto site. I know that I cannot use my Doge for purchases nor can I transfer it to a digital wallet of my choosing, so basically I am buying it from RobinHoods huge stake they have in house and my purchases don’t even affect the markets.

In the meantime I have educated myself and also set up a account with Coinbase (I know they don’t sell it) and I have Kraken.

All of this adds up to a huge NO way for me, so my options are limited and none are really that great.

1. Sell my Doge at about a $100 to $250 loss

2. Wait for RobinHood to set up digital wallet to transfer the coin then. But they have promised this feature for some time and have failed to deliver the goods.

I cannot and will not support RobinHood after all the bad things they have done in the stock market and seem to be doing on the crypto side. I just want to be free and clear especially with all the looming troubles they are in and what may happen when more bad things are discovered and people are bag holders because of this.

Thanks and Doge on!",dogecoin

t3_m7v2yl,Boycott ROBINHOOD NOW!!!,"For all of you that are new to buying crypto and for the tenured people who do know about cryptocurrency the news on RobinHood is this;

1)  if at any point in time you choose to invest in any cryptocurrency that they allow you will not own that coin. you were only purchasing coin for RobinHood to hold themselves under your name. you will never own that coin. therefore you are not allowed to use it. that is massively flawed because the point is cryptocurrency is meant to be used as a form of currency for purchases digitally. This one practice is massively disrespectful to the customers of RobinHood.

2) RobinHood will take 5 to 7 days to give you your money if you ever decide to cash out. In comparison to other platforms that do not take that long. the reason they take this long is so that they can use the money you have provided Robinhood to turn more money on their behalf.
 
3) If there is ever a point in time you have a problem and reach out to their customer service it takes them 5 to 7 days to initially respond to you. on top of which every time you send a correlating response to their initial response you get another customer service agent that is not the one that initially picked up your problem. thus causing you to go in circles

4)  Robinhood has claimed that they will make wallets for people who own cryptocurrency they have yet to do this and they have not begun doing this to my knowledge they have simply stated it to appease the masses. 

These 4 reasons alone are enough to show that RobinHood is complete garbage and trash. DO NOT USE them!!!! UNLESS you want nothing but problems. I personally do not care that they’re interface is pretty that 1 thing does not make up for the massive flaws that they have.",dogecoin

t3_m8921l,RH to blame: so u r wondering where stimny? where lambo??? here is why stimmy didnt putdoge on the moon - u dumped it all into RH,"here is the issue - most of u dumped stimmy into RH

RH does not always source doge from open markets or exchanges. they source doge from their own pools or dark pools.. some say they actually pretend to hold any doge for u while betting  against u.. that u will cash out at a loss and they keep the diff as profit.. in any case the money u put in RH had no bearing on the overrall markets .. u just bought some doge from RH.. u didnt even buy it.. u bought a claim to doge RH owns in their wallet.. so all the stimmy has Vladimir Tenev the CEO of RH laughing all the way to the bank..

if u want stimmy to hit u need to put your money into an actual wallet thru coinflip or voyager or binance.. anything that actually provides ownership of doge thru keys.. new wallets is also an important metric in bull investment analysis.. the more wallets the better for crypto like doge

right now u just hold a promise to repay u at market prices when u cash out from robbin hood ..  the doge all in RH wallet or whatever fantasy portfolio they ""hold"" for u - they are the biggest whale to dismantle 

help take doge to friggin andromeda by shifting at least some into real wallets so u can actually spend it too

t3_m7yvjw,"Adopt a Dog, #AdoptaDogecoin","Hey [r](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/)/dogecoin -- 

We're Finn -- a small company that makes dog vitamins and *really* loves dogs. We just launched #AdoptaDogecoin -- our mission is to send doggy adoptions to the moon 🚀!

TLDR:

* We bought 100k DOGE, and **we'll send anyone who adopts a shelter dog 500 DOGE.**
* We're accepting DOGE payments on our site, and donating 100% of profits paid in DOGE directly to shelters.
* We'd love your help spreading the word.

**Why are we doing this?** We thought this could be a really neat way to find lots of loving homes for lots of loving dogs. Dogecoin and the DOGE community are much special. We like using the internet for good thing.

**How's it work?** We'll send anyone who adopts a shelter dog 500 DOGE. Just send us a photo of your new best friend, your adoption certificate, and your wallet address.

**How can you help?** Well, lots of ways:

* Adopt a dog! That's the ultimate goal, after all. Let us know once you do.
* If you're a shelter (or you know of one) who would like to get involved, let's connect. We'd like to enroll as many shelters as possible.
* Help spread the word: We've created lots of [fun memes](https://adoptadogecoin.org/) that you can share around. Send us some Twitter love and spread the word; you know the deal. The #DogeArmy is strong.
* Get involved; we could use the help! We're a small team with a big idea. If you see an opportunity to add value or help out in any way, please reach out -- we'd love to have you onboard -- really.

**Get in touch:** We're here, ask us anything. You can also find us at:

t3_m16uon,Decentralization-Boosting Mining Protocol Stratum V2: Overview &amp; Progress Update,"Over the past year, we've explained many benefits of the Stratum V2 mining protocol **for miners, pools, and the Bitcoin network as a whole**. Now it's time for a recap &amp; update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 &amp; BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&amp;A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/upgrade\/compare-mining-protocols](https://preview.redd.it/lfabnz5z30m61.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0deab79ca092c68515e9c8af5f5492c88c4f1b6)

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners &amp; mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&amp;D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

&gt;[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

&gt;""[Bitcoin’s Decentralization with Stratum V2](https://braiins.com/blog/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization)""

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/blog\/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization](https://preview.redd.it/vo0x4d1m50m61.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12daa1f9f8dc2f10b861759d8f465a08eb0b442)

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",Bitcoin

t3_m7vge3,A warning to others I lost $5000 to a scam utterly embarrassed and ashamed to share this but hopefully it might save another,"

I had £5000 GBP that I had saved and I was determined to finally try make something of my money.

I spent weeks learning how to read charts/technical analysis and as I became more confident I wanted to learn further. I have $6900 spread across some reasonably safe coin but no greed got the better of me...

I was following JRNY Crypto since I got into this mid Feb. He was always talking about his memberships and I became really curious and wanted to get involved.

I saw him post a message on Twitter about his membership commenting on what one of his subscribers had said. I was convinced this would be a good decision. 

So later that day I messaged JRNY crypto... or atleast... I thought I did... 

Earlier that day I followed someone called @JRNYcryptto 


i didn’t realise the extra T I messaged this guy and expressed my desire to join his membership program we actually had a good conversation he broke down the different types of membership and I was sold he directed me to this trading platform 

Bitcryptotrade.net

Because I messaged him first there were no red flags.. I thought the trading platform looked a bit crappy but still no red flags... I head to the subscription page where I deposited 5 grand... saying it out loud and reading as I type is making me feel utterly sick that I could be so fucking retarded....

The premise was that he would trade with my funds and after he had achieved the certain ROI he’d take 20% and I would take the rest. Like you pay a an investment banker. I had sunk a few whiskies earlier in the evening which I knew clouded my judgement..

It wasn’t until after I had deposited.. that I felt the urge to check something... I remember in a JRNY video he was aiming for 100k Twitter following. I went back on Twitter and noticed this guy had 20k.. dread filled my soul I then noticed the extra T..

I knew at that moment I was never seeing a single penny of that money ever again.... I brought this new discovery to his attention. He claimed he has a second account so that he can message prospects. I knew it was total bullshit but I was worried that he had some of my info and I was nervous this could get worse..

He kept reassuring me this was real and I should relax.. a few days later he aggressively try’s to convince me that I had to pay his 20% commission fee upfront I couldn’t  believe the balls of this guy... I told him that wasn’t gonna happen I had very little left basically $1700 from my original £5000..

He then try’s to befriend me saying not to worry about the fee and continued to try reassure me.. I went along with it due to worries he may be able to hack my wallet to retrieve my last few coins. Lastly he says for me to withdraw my profits at the end of day 5 I’d need to pay a $5000 withdrawal fee. 

Neither the commission fee or withdrawal fee was ever mentioned prior to me depositing funds. He tried to take advantage of the fact I was all in and tried to exploit another 11 grand out of me. Not once was I ever going to pay..

I thought I was a smart guy but I’m a dumb fucking idiot who deserved all of this. To make matters worse I have been bombarded by fund recovery scammers...

I have only a tiny bit left and every day I’m lying to my partner about how my crypto investing is going..

For the love of god don’t be as retarded as me please read this, feel free to laugh and ridicule I deserve it... read this and remember even if you think you’re talking to a legitimate person with good intentions even  if YOU message them first...

t3_m7bmr1,Warning: STOP buying Bitcoin on Robinhood. These guys almost went under to a 3b margin call on illegal $GME paper trades. They will rob you and go broke.,"If this applies to you, seriously what are you thinking? We’ve been shouting “don’t buy BTC on RH” from the rooftops. The latest update is finding out that RH has admitted to paper trading $GME and fucking investors when their naked positions caught a 3 billion dollar margin call.

If this had been a Bitcoin related event, there would have been no recovery, RH would have filed for bankruptcy and relied on their elite friends to manage any government intervention that may crop up.

 RH basically shorted every order their client’s made, not only stabbing those clients in the back short term, but setting them up to lose everything if they were right. If $GME had gone to $1,000 some of these folks would have been left with less than their buy-in because RH would have gone under.

Returning to Bitcoin, it’s important to understand that this deceptive practice is even more easily perpetrated against RH’s BTC buyers and that Congress / regulators are even less likely to do anything about it.

For the love of Satoshi, I know at least one of you reading this is still not selling the Bitcoin you have on RH, transferring your fiat to a legitimate exchange, rebuying the Bitcoin, and storing it off exchange. Stupid games, stupid prizes, and you can’t be entirely dumb if you’ve read this far. Make the move right now and sleep better knowing your coins are safe and so is the integrity of the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

Other exchanges to consider include: Gemini, Kraken, Binance US, Coinsebase Pro, Swan, and if you’re a real legend BISQ. 

If this is your first time hearing this stuff, search r/Bitcoin for Robinhood and checkout this recent r/wallstreetbets thread detailing RH’s 3 billion dollar margin call https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m74e3g/this_is_huge_robinhood_never_owned_your_gme/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

TL:DR - RH probably isn’t buying Bitcoin when you buy Bitcoin on RH. If Bitcoin rallies hard enough, or if RH has an internal problem, you’re likely to lose everything. Move your funds off of RH.",Bitcoin

And although many do not see real inflation in the United States, it is growing rapidly in the rest of the world.***

https://preview.redd.it/qs8axr8iqrn61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f902a1b416a2472c37d4fb95504a7e45c22044

Alex Gladstein, chief strategic director of the Foundation for Human Rights, [said](https://news.bitcoin.com/1-2-billion-people-live-under-double-digit-inflation-many-have-found-escape-in-bitcoin-says-hrfs-alex-gladstein/) that *1.2 billion of the world's citizens live in inflation that reaches two to three digits.*

**Inflation is the silent killer of human purchasing power.**

Over the past week, a number of analysts and economists have discussed a possible rise in US inflation, mainly due to the huge volumes of stimulus created in 2020 and 2021. This has led economists to believe that inflation will soon come to the US as the Federal Reserve is cornered by plans to keep the easy money schemes for 2021.

The biggest sell-off of US government bonds in recent history is a direct harbinger of inflation. And although the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds rose from 0.9% to 1.6%, this cannot suit investors watching how the stock market and the bitcoin market grow. It even ""*led to the worst quarter for Treasury investors in more than four years*,"" according to Ice Data Services.

Bob Prince, the hedge fund manager of the Bridgewater Associates, [warned](https://news.bitcoin.com/hedge-fund-manager-says-sell-off-in-us-treasury-bonds-a-threat-to-high-flying-assets-like-btc/) that the recent sell-off in the US government bond market could accelerate and it could “threaten high-yielding assets” such as cryptocurrencies and companies with negative earnings.

However, more than 1.2 billion people living in countries with double-digit inflation do not have access to high-quality assets, but they have easy access to one global asset that does not require special knowledge or licenses. And this asset is bitcoin. People simply have nowhere to go, no one agitates them to buy bitcoin. They are forced to do it.

If the fears of Ice Data Services analysts and large institutional investors come true, and the sale of American Treasuries continues in the current quarter, then it will be very difficult to avoid inflation in the US. In this case, large American investors will simply have nowhere to go. They will be forced to hedge the risks of depreciating Bitcoin assets.

Another important indirect confirmation of the real threat of inflation is the position of the main economic media. In particular, Bloomberg Economics editor Peter Coy wrote an editorial titled ""[Tune Out the Hyperinflation Hype](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-04/why-hyperinflation-won-t-happen-in-u-s-like-in-venezuela-or-zimbabwe)"", portraying investor concerns as ""hype"" and manifestation of ""conspiracy theory."" Coy even noted that fear of inflation only helps drive the price of BTC. A number of other media outlets, as if on cue, have released similar articles claiming that the fear of inflation is all fiction and conspiracy theories.

However, according to the latest Bank of America (BoA) poll, which surveyed 220 fund managers with more than $ 630 billion in assets, “inflation” is the largest risk for the markets, outweighing all other risks, including Covid-19.

When doing a fundamental analysis of Bitcoin price movements in the first half of 2021, you should first look at two things: the sale of American Treasuries and the real inflation rate in the United States. *There are the answers to the question about the next peaks in the price of bitcoin.*",Bitcoin

t3_m8bls5,Positive Prospect of BitCoin’s Future,"**一．** **The Development Process of Bitcoin**

Almost a week has passed since March 12, the trend of Bitcoin has risen unprecedentedly.

Reviewing the development of Bitcoin, Bitcoin was developed in January 2009, then quickly developed and slowly began to gain a certain degree of popularity in the market. From the black swan plunge on March 12th, 2020 to the increasing on March 12th, 2021, the development of Bitcoin in the past year has made us more firmly aware of the positive trend of Bitcoin in the future.

**二．** **The Black Swan on March, 12th 2020**

On the eve before March 12th, 2020, influenced by Covid-19, the panic hit the global financial market. China’s market, U.S. stocks, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and other markets collapsed collectively. Influenced at the background of the US's massive printing to rescue the market, the global financial market gradually entered a stable.

From March 8th to March 13th in the year 2020, Bitcoin~~s~~ pushed down from $9,000. In less than a week, the lowest once fell to $3800. The total liquidation was over $50 billion. Bitcoins encountered a liquidity crisis, major exchanges collectively shut down the service, and investors were extremely pessimistic, believing that the Cryptocurrency market would collapse.

However, opportunities and despair coexist. Bitcoin dropped to 3,800 dollars and then quickly REBOUNDED After more than a month of slow climbing, Bitcoin once again broke the MA60 which is also called the bull-bear boundary, and returned to be above $9,000. After the third halving of Bitcoin, its scarcity has become more obvious. The influx of a large number of institutions has boosted Bitcoin's further strength, creating an unprecedented super bull market. 

Lucian, the chief analyst of BitOffer Exchange, said that in fact, the cryptocurrency market has undergone earth-shaking changes in the past year. The most important thing is that institutions enter the market to maintain the overall stability of the market, which means that predicting schemes are hard to arrange anymore.

Before the Bitcoin breakthrough to $20,000 happened, Bitcoin~~s~~ always kept up and down. After buying, HODL always brought a loss. There is a saying in the cryptocurrency market, that is, nowadays there seems rarely to appear the ups and downs state, which thanks to the entry of international investment banking institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Grayscale, Fidelity, and Citigroup, as well as the public purchase of a large number of listed companies, the overall stability of the market has been improved, which also shows that the Cryptocurrency market is gradually maturing.

**三．** **BitCoin went up to $60,000 on March 12th, 2021**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ezposrudpxn61.png?width=1863&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be51ae9e6f38134810780412180a3c04186acd37

On March, 12th, 2021. the BTC went up to $60,000. (According to the data on the image).

The Black Swan made more investors extremely pessimistic. On March, 12th, 2021, the BTC continued to rise, breaking through the unprecedented $60,000 USD. The curse of“Black Swan” on March 12, 2021, has been removed.

This is mainly due to the following reasons:

On March 7th,2021, Biden failed his plan to stimulate $1.9 trillion. It means there will amount of cash going into the crypto market. The buying treasures of investors will be beneficial to make a historic breakthrough in Bitcoins. Therefore, there is no need for investors to take more care about the coming of March 12th. At present, the upward trend of Bitcoin remains very good. If there is a corresponding correction in the short term, it is still a good entry point. In terms of the general trend, we believe that Bitcoin will rise to more than $100,000 this year.

**四．** **Earn Profits according to the uptrend of BitCoins**

According to the data of BitOffer, the global crypto investors tend to buy Bitcoin’s ETF funds for the reasons that Bitcoin’s ETF funds support buying the ups and downs of Bitcoins and costs free fees and free liquidation. The profits of ETF funds are 3-17 times higher than spot trading. So it is the best way to buy ETF funds. Now the market value scale of Bitoffer platform investors is more than US$1 billion. 

As for the leveraged ETF fund, there are obvious advantages that the ETF fund has free deposit and fees and no liquidation and can enjoy high profits of 3 times to 17 times. Lucian said BitOffer’s leveraged ETF fund will gradually replace the contrast of the current market.

**五．** **The future of BitOffer’s BitCoin can be in high expectation.**

Bitoffer developed new products for DOT、LINK、UNI、SUSHI. Lucian said most of any other mainstream currency and DeFi currency would be developed to satisfy the needs of crypto market investors. Now it is very active in leveraged ETF Fund trading. Especially in the primary subscription market, the total monthly subscription volume exceeded $1 billion, which is even much higher than the spot transaction volume.",Bitcoin

I'm thinking it goes way down because the demand will go way down. Then what?  It slowly goes up, but faster than other assets?  This is a very real scenario to contemplate.

I’m hoping that sharing this will be of value to some in the community. 

I recently decided to scroll back through my coinbase buying history. I bought my first 11 Bitcoins at $184! The date was jan 14th, 2015. Like many others, I sold them a year later at (what i considered, at the time) a considerable gain. Looking back, of course I wish I still had the coins. 

The point being... no one knew! Lots of people sold around this time. You simply cannot beat yourself up for cashing out when it felt right. You can’t dwell on the past. 

In late 2017, I started building my btc holdings back up. I have been buying consistently for the last 4 years and have yet to sell a single satoshi! 

This time around is different! I’m glad to say, I feel good about my portfolio. However, it’s worth mentioning that we are in the early stages of this new world! 

I have many friends who reach out saying “I wish I had bought years ago, now it’s $60,000 a coin”. I try to explain.. when it’s $1,000,000 per coin, I would hate to hear you say.. “I wish I had bought when it was $60,000”.

    Bitcoin mining is voluntary and bitcoin miners only mine bitcoin to make a profit and they turn off their miners when it's no longer profitable for them to mine. Bitcoin mining will use substantially less electricity by summer of 2032 because the block reward will be just 0.78125 BTC and the mining difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks which is approximately two weeks. This is just a small part of [bitcoin protocol rules](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules) that Satoshi created.

    In 2019, [the bitcoin network was getting 74.1% of its electricity from renewables](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18642645/bitcoin-energy-price-renewable-china), making it “more renewables-driven than almost every other large-scale industry in the world.” In 2021, it will be using even more renewables and that only increases with time.

    [Here's a full report on bitcoin mining that was done in 2019](https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-december-2019), one year before mining started in Mongolia in 2020 which was banned this year.

    There was a Cambridge study done on bitcoin mining in 2020 but 2020 is exactly when bitcoin miners set up shop in the Mongolian region of China and started using electricity generated from coal but that only lasted less than a year because the [Chinese government has now banned bitcoin mining in that region of China and they also banned mining bitcoin with dirty energy](https://www.coindesk.com/inner-mongolia-to-shut-down-crypto-mining-industry-report) and now bitcoin can be mined with mainly clean renewable energy once again like it previously was.

    Perhaps we should worry about video games or youtube because [video games and youtube use more electricity than bitcoin](https://i.redd.it/ncmwuesezrg61.jpg) and we all know that's residential electricity so most of that energy doesn't come from renewable resources. Humans really need to generate more renewable energy and rely less on dirty energy. I'm glad that [large scale bitcoin mining is driving clean energy innovation](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-large-scale-bitcoin-mining-is-driving-clean-energy-innovation-2021-01-06) because the world really needs it at this time, much like we needed scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked, that is, before Satoshi created bitcoin for us.

    Bitcoin is currently at the second stage of the evolution of money which is a store of value. Gold is currently the #1 largest asset on earth by market cap because it's used by humans as a store of value and it has been for centuries. Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold and it's much easier send, protect, and hide and it's also more scarce than gold. Gold mining and transporting gold are both far worse for the environment than mining bitcoin and transporting bitcoin. Gold mining emits more than three times the co2 emissions than bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold and bitcoin can also be used for payments and as currency and the lightning network allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for extremely low fees, and it can handle hundreds of millions of transactions per second. [Click here to see a list of the top 100 assets by market cap.](https://8marketcap.com/) Gold is #1 with a market cap of $11 trillion and bitcoin is #8 with a market cap of $1 trillion. Almost all of that value sitting in gold being inefficiently stored and guarded in vaults can more easily and efficiently be stored on the bitcoin blockchain and more people will continue to realize this as bitcoin continues to remain at the second stage of the evolution of money which is a store of value.

    [This bar graph](https://i.redd.it/wv4bfba5p4h61.jpg) shows the energy expenditure and yearly cost of gold mining and bitcoin mining.

    This isn't the second millennium anymore and we have better technology now. Gold is just too inefficient and bad for the environment for people to be using as a store of value anymore and if we stopped doing that then the price would come down to it's true value and it would be extremely cheap for the minuscule amount that we do use in electronics, thus lowering the price of electronics. Gold is shiny and makes pretty jewelry and also makes great corrosion resistant semiconductors. It's difficult and expensive to transport and it requires equipment to reliably test it's authenticity. It's also difficult and expensive to adequately guard and protect. All of the value of gold could sit on the blockchain instead of sitting in a vault being guarded and it also wouldn't need to be transported in a jet in order to transfer it to someone.

    Bitcoin's blockchain is layer 1 and is used for large payments/settlements/transactions and the lightning network is bitcoin's layer 2 and is used for smaller instant payments/transactions. People are transferring $500M+ worth of bitcoin, half the time over a $billion worth of bitcoin, [in every single block](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks), all day, every day. The lightning network can handle an unlimited amount of users and hundreds of millions of transactions per second which is magnitudes more transactions than visa/mastercard can handle. 

    **Money always evolves in the following four stages:**

    **1. Collectible:** In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads, and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.

    **2. Store of value:** Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.

    **3. Medium of exchange:** When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange. In the earliest days of Bitcoin, many people did not appreciate the huge opportunity cost of using bitcoins as a medium of exchange, rather than as an incipient store of value. The famous story of a man trading 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas illustrates this confusion.

    **4. Unit of account:** When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. That is, the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods. It is a common misconception that bitcoin prices are available for many goods today. For example, while a cup of coffee might be available for purchase using bitcoins, the price listed is not a true bitcoin price; rather it is the dollar price desired by the merchant translated into bitcoin terms at the current USD/BTC market exchange rate. If the price of bitcoin were to drop in dollar terms, the number of bitcoins requested by the merchant would increase commensurately. Only when merchants are willing to accept bitcoins for payment without regard to the bitcoin exchange rate against fiat currencies can we truly think of Bitcoin as having become a unit of account.

The Blockchain is immutable, meaning it can be added to, but nothing can be removed except by consensus.  And to change the data would mean a fork, right?

These links and inputs are disturbing.  You might laugh when I post this from a PCMAG article in 2018, but think this through.  If this is possible, at some point content could be loaded into the block chain that is so dangerous, or threatening, or objectionable that it could cause a problem. 

Here are some of the issues within the blockchain:

"" Among the data was the child pornographic content found in three files; the 274 links were lists that directed to sites found on the [D](https://www.pcmag.com/news/inside-the-dark-web)ark Web.

Let's say I am lucky and I make €500 per month worth of BTC coins. I want to keep the profit in coins. So I send 300 every month to a cold wallet and leave rest for liquidity inside exchange. Isn't the transaction fee something crazy like €35 per transaction today? So essentially I'd be losing 35 every 300 due to security in cold wallet.

t3_m79l3c,Bitcoin's fair launch cannot ever be replicated by another cryptocurrency,"I created this thread to point out some distinct and important differences between the launch of bitcoin compared to the launch of every other cryptocurrency. I realize that many of you already know these facts, but some of you don't.

Bitcoin, the most secure and decentralized cryptocurrency (I'm not debating it), was created to solve the problem of trust with governments and to be a store of value that can be sent/received anywhere/anytime without permission or trust of anyone else. Bitcoin’s narrative matches the real world utility. If you want to get technical, bitcoin is really a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. 

**To ensure that the launch was considered fair, Satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:**

- **No premine** (Satoshi didn’t grant himself any coins)
- **Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network** (no sudden release and no mining before release)
- **Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely** (this cannot even be replicated)
- **Satoshi never cashed out** (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)

Putting everything else about bitcoin aside, there will never be another cryptocurrency that is launched as fairly as bitcoin, for all of eternity, because bitcoin's fair launch cannot ever be replicated. Now that the genies out of the bottle and bitcoin is here, it's 100% impossible to ever have a cryptocurrency where the coins are circulating in the wild freely for 18 months before having any value. I also don't think that we'll ever see another cryptocurrency created where the founder never cashes out.",Bitcoin

t3_m7t5q1,[App] Blitzcoin - Trade your stuff for crypto currency.,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I just published an app, that many of you might be interested in. So let me introduce you to Blitzcoin 😉

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, there's no ""real"" place, where crypto-folks like us, can exchange products/services for crypto currency.

Sure there is craigslist, which offers this as an option, but craigslist is not used worldwide. Most countries have their own ""craigslist"" clone, but not all of them offer an option for crypto currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

**That's where Blitzcoin comes in.**

&amp;#x200B;

Blitzcoin's main focus is to give people a place to offer products/services exclusevily for crypto currency. As of right now, Bitcoin is the main currency for exchange, which may be extended in the future to include other currencies as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

In it's current version, Blitzcoin offers the majority of core functionalities (add products/services, searching for products/services, messaging, etc...), thoroughly tested and fully working. The UI follows a simple and minimalistic approach, for ease of use.

&amp;#x200B;

Blitzcoin does not offer transactions. But depending on the success of the app, and your feedback, this and additional features can be implemented in future releases.

&amp;#x200B;

**Feel free to get it for your device:**

&amp;#x200B;

iOS:

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blitzcoin/id1553313382](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blitzcoin/id1553313382)

&amp;#x200B;

Android:

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.blitzcoin.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.blitzcoin.app)

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions or feedback, let me know in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some FAQs you also might be interested in**

&amp;#x200B;

Q: The app asks for my location, why?

A: Since it's meant to be a worldwide release, it shows you products within a range of your current location.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why is nothing showing up?

A: It's because I decided to launch the app without fake-data! So, if you're one of the first in your region to install the app, just wait a few days ( or weeks/months depending on the success of the app) until there are offerings near you, or go ahead and create an offering.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What about privacy and terms?

A: [https://blitzcoin.biz/privacy/](https://blitzcoin.biz/privacy/)

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Everything is so slow, some features aren't even working, why's that?

A: It's because the app went viral, and neither I nor the infrastructure were prepared for that 😂",Bitcoin

As a reference point, about 95% of total Bitcoin is owned by the top 2.4% of addresses with the largest balances.

A small set of total accounts owns a massive portion of Bitcoin, leaving the asset vulnerable to sharp price swings on account of movements in these “whale” accounts.

1. The amount of BTC is limited: 21 million will ever be produced. -&gt; People lose access to their secret keys. -&gt; The amount of ""usuable"" BTC decreases -&gt; What happens if all coins or most of them are lost? Doesn't it mean that BTC is already bound to fail?
2. Fees. In the future miners will have no more BTC to mine. -&gt; They will be more concentrated on transaction fees -&gt; Fees for a transaction will go up -&gt; What stops this fees from going up to e.g. 500000% of the amount to transferred itself?

How many ""new"" millionaires are there from just these alone? And even deeper - given the way society ""was"".. how many normal people would have even had opportunities to be millionaires prior to these events?

I find it really wild that a normal person with a laptop can in theory break out of the middle class with years of hodl or investing in a short stock (I'm aware the $GME short isn't happening with every stock, or happening often).

t3_m7wmni,Seeking Yield Amid a Global Debt Bubble,"The Real Vision Crypto Interview: Jason Leibowitz, CEO and co-founder of [LeboBTC Ledger Group (LLG)](https://www.lebobtc.com), joins Ash Bennington, Real Vision senior editor, to discuss #Bitcoin custody solutions, growing interest in Bitcoin from traditional investors, and the global debt bubble. As central banks worldwide are engaging in loose monetary policy in an attempt to blunt the economic effects of the pandemic, Leibowitz shares that many of his clients understand the global macro story—as a result, people are increasingly interested in Bitcoin. In an era of historically low bond rates, he reiterates how this has spurred many investors to reallocate their portfolios in new assets as they are pushed out the risk curve seeking yield. Leibowitz explains the importance of self-custody of Bitcoin, but recognizes the difficulty of onboarding new people who are unfamiliar with how the new technology works. With the global debt bubble growing from drastic QE efforts and concerns over increasing debt on the Fed’s balance sheet, Leibowitz says that holding dollars in your portfolio, especially for corporate treasurers, is like holding a melting ice cube. Filmed on March 11, 2021.

Key Learnings: Traditional investors are becoming more attracted to assets such as Bitcoin as the global debt bubble grows, central banks continue to engage in quantitative easing and suppress rates, and currency debasement risk increases. Self-custody of Bitcoin is important to reduce custodian risks and costs, but can be difficult for people new to the technology.

The email actually came from google so i clicked it and it opened a google docs document file within the browser. It had written it was from Bitmain and was saying how the latest miners are on sale blah blah and the document had a link in it. I didnt click the actual link, i realised it was a scam when i saw the google docs file as it was really weird. 

I then found this article explaining how this is a pretty common attack lately:

What I mean by that is,is there technical ways to ensure the average person doesn't lose access to their keys? (not meaning funds in that context)

Bitcoin is one thing, but I've understood that bitcoin can also be used to ""prove"" ownership of something by signing a message on the blockchain.

So if you lose your keys, you're losing the ownership of the thing you signed...theoretically, maybe a car, a house, a paper, a song, a domain, an email, a brand.

That's the possible extensions of bitcoin I could think of.

Except if the average person can lose access that easily, then it's a bit worrying.

It will never be used and there will be a central entity to manage the ownership, rendering bitcoin a bit less useful than what I've expected (money is still a huge deal).

So, does anyone have thought this out? Am I getting worried for good reasons?

Is there technical solutions to mitigate the loss of those digital possessions, without having to rely on a third party?

t3_m76c64,Imagining a $1M Bitcoin World,"... Would this be a good thing? I'm not entirely sure. Not intended to be FUD, more of a thought exercise down a dystopian rabbit hole...

$1M Bitcoin most likely means the dollar has significantly deteriorated in value. Think about all your friends and family who do not own Bitcoin. Their wages and savings are now worth a fraction of what they were before. At the same time, cost of living and assets have gone up, so not only is their money worth less, it can't buy as much. Some of them know you own, and maybe start asking for help. Some of these people might be the same ones who laughed at you for buying in the first place. It's easy to say, ""You should've listened to me"" but they're hurting. You don't want to see them hurt.

Maybe the non-coiners start blaming the crypto community for this new state of affairs. It would be wrong, but someone needs to take the fall. Central banks might pile on to this blame game, too. That, in turn, motivates politicians to do the same. Maybe they try to push a crypto ban. But at this point there's so much institutional money in the game it makes a ban tough to rationalize -- especially with all their big money campaign contributors. So they demonize it instead. They say that Bitcoin is unpatriotic, anti-society, greedy, selfish... etc. They can't stop Bitcoin but they can certainly try and push it to the margins, into the underground and out of the mainstream economy. Bitcoin now has a negative stigma. Doing business in crypto becomes significantly harder. It's not clear who you can talk to about this anymore. Maybe this pushes the price up? Maybe it pushes it down?

Meanwhile, some countries embrace crypto and become crypto havens with progressive crypto laws. These are great places to live if you own crypto but the cost of living in these places is dramatically higher than non-crypto places because all coiners want to move there. Your Bitcoin is still good but it can't buy as much as you like. And maybe these crypto enclaves have higher rates of crypto-related theft because criminals know it's a target-rich environment. Sure crypto is easier to live off of, but you have to be on high-alert all the time to protect your assets and your physical safety.

... like I said, not intended to be FUD.

t3_m7v407,Potential BTC Crash Scenario From a Crypto Noob,"Hi guys thanks for entertaining this question.   


I've been into crypto recently holding decent percentages of BTC and ETH in my portfolio. As I continue to delve deeper into the world, now trying to trade off the currency's price action, I stumbled onto certain facts:  


1. Many exchanges peg their crypto against USDT. I mean USDT at this point is just USD to us and most people just do swaps but its basically using ur dollar to buy crypto. Its the most widely accepted way to swap for all the coins out there. Make sense.  

2. USDT is sketch however. From what I read:    
""**BUSD** is regulated and audited. They ensure that every **BUSD** is backed 1:1 by a physical dollar stored in FDIC-insured US banks. **USDT** is not audited and has had security breaches and lawsuits in the past. They don't guarantee a physical dollar backs every **USDT** and the money that does back it is stored in offshore banks.""  
Now I'm not trying to promote BUSD, but if this is the case, I think y'all know what I am getting at.  
(TL;DR)  
**WHATS STOPPING THE PEOPLE FROM TETHER FROM JUST PRINTING INFINITE USDT AND PUMPING ALL THE COINS OUT THERE TO EVENTUALLY CRASH THE VALUE OF ALL THE COINS INCLUDING BTC?** Say everyone wants to cash out their crypto into fiat (understandably) for their various uses which obviously fiat is still better for. Would there be a case where people try to go back to the paper trail and realise that they've been fed air this whole time?

Mentioned:	GBTC V
Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) prices remained steady at around $55,200 on Wednesday morning after one Wall Street analyst blasted the cryptocurrency for all of its shortcomings as both an inflation hedge and a store of wealth.

Prices Based Purely On Demand: Bank of America analyst Francisco Blanch said bitcoin is akin to other commodities in that its price is driven purely by supply and demand. Given bitcoin's supply is fixed, swings in demand are the only thing driving its price action.

Blanch said weekly flows into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC: GBTC) are a significant demand driver and contributor and to near-term price action.

Blanch said that, despite its popularity among retail traders, bitcoin has several major problems that might hold it back in the long-term. One of its biggest hurdles is the complex nature of the crypto mining that underlies its settlement process. Blanch said bitcoin can only handle about 14,000 transactions per hour compared to the 236 million transactions Visa Inc (NYSE: V) can reportedly handle.

'Bitcoin has also become correlated to risk assets, it is not tied to inflation, and remains exceptionally volatile, making it impractical as a store of wealth or payments mechanism,' Blanch wrote in the note.

Blanch said the main argument for holding bitcoin in a portfolio is not diversification, stable returns or protection against inflation. It's simply the expectation that prices will rise.

Low ESG Rating: At the same time, Blanch said ESG investors will likely have no interest in bitcoin, which has an extremely harmful environmental impact. The bitcoin network currently emits about 60 million tons of CO2 annually, roughly the same carbon footprint as the nation of Greece. For every $1 billion of fresh inflow into bitcoin, Blanch estimates the cryptocurrency will generate additional CO2 levels equivalent to about 1.2 million ICE cars.

When it comes to social and governance measures, Blanch said the anonymity of cryptocurrency networks contributes to their use for nefarious activities.

'Reprisk, an ESG tracker, found 181 companies faced risks linked to Bitcoin around money laundering, corruption, bribery, fraud, and breaches of data privacy,' Blanch said.

Finally, Blanch said bitcoin is facing tremendous long-term threats from central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. There is currently nothing preventing central banks from building their own blockchains and replicating the bitcoin network, and the ECB is reportedly already discussing its own CBDC.

Benzinga's Take: A key driver of the recent bitcoin rally is concerns over the negative impact unprecedented government stimulus spending could have on the dollar.

A cryptocurrency's supply is fixed, it doesn't have the intrinsic value of a share of stock or a plot of real estate, and it doesn't have the yield of a bond or certificate of deposit. Therefore, the prices of cryptocurrencies in the long term will be determined only by changes in long-term demand from investors and users.",Bitcoin

t3_m7anoh,Visa / MasterCard / Large Financial Institution Involvement - Where does that leave us?,"Hey all,

I'm starting to see more and more overjoyed responses across the cryptosphere of people sharing articles like Visa and Mastercard, Paypal etc integrating more crypto and bringing it mainstream. While I'm really glad to see crypto finally pushing through the barriers that were placed in front of it, I can't help wonder what potential ramifications could take place.

The *first sentence* of the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) says the following:

&gt; A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution 

I'm concerned about financial institution's involvement and their desire to control assets, especially those like bitcoin which they've been fighting tooth and nail over for a decade. With the massive influx of institutional money, where does that leave us? I'm not necessarily against it, but I hate to see bank get involved in the first place. Perhaps I'm an outlier, and realistically I'm not sure I see other ways of pushing adoption. Is this something to worry over or what?

E.g., I'm referring to announcements like [this](https://decrypt.co/61738/visa-is-working-to-enable-bitcoin-purchases-ceo) where Visa openly says they're trying to facilitate those purchases for people, basically being the intermediate we were trying to get rid of.",Bitcoin

t3_m7fu4j,Struggling to figure out Cryptocurrency taxes using Koinly Software,"I have never paid tax for crypto trades that I made back in 2017/2018/2019. I tried figuring out those year taxes using the Koinly software, but the gaps in transactions and errors I am getting are getting over my head. I have spent around 12 hours importing data and trying to follow the crypto trail for the coins that state have $0 cost basis, but I am having such a hard time figuring it out. The Koinly software isn't doing me much favors- I was under the impression that it would be able to connect all the dots as long as I provided the vast majority of my trade/deposit/withdrawal history. 

&amp;#x200B;

Issues that I am having:

1. Most of my errors are from Binance. Since Binance is no longer available for US customers, they do not allow me to generate an API. I have had to generate multiple CSV files for my trades/withdrawals/deposits, yet there still are a lot of errors regarding my Binance transactions. It also shows that I have several cryptocurrency balances which I do not have, and it points to my Binance exchange. Kucoin 
2. A lot of the transactions appear to be generated incorrectly. The software classified capital gains for a lot of transactions that were just transfers to another wallet, for example.
3. It is missing cost basis for coins that have gone through token swaps, such as Vechain. I manually go in and put in the VEN-VET token swap, but then it shows an error that my VET token balance is 'X' amount higher than my actual balance reported in my wallet.
4. There were a couple ICO's that I participated in 2018. One that I deposited ETH to had some kind of lawsuit stating that un-credited investors could not participate. The project ended up dying and I never got my ETH back. Another I invested in had the token value drop to practically 0 after the 2018 crash. My wallet still shows I have the tokens, but I cannot sell them anywhere. I don't know how to write these off as a loss against my gains. On Koinly, I click ""Lost Crypto"" but it doesn't correctly change my realized taxable gains.

These are just some examples of the headaches I am having. I am thinking about going to a CPA, but I am not sure how they would figure this out all for me. What information would I need to provide them? A lot of the information I had to manually import due to not having APIs (Bittrex, Binance, Old Kucoin). Would I provide them my Koinly profile information? I don't even know at this point if a CPA could help me figure this out. Some guidance would be greatly appreciated!",Bitcoin

t3_m73q06,Is your bank not allowing you to buy bitcoin?,"I've seen a lot of questions in the daily lately about banks not allowing transactions to crypto exchanges. I'm one of the people who encountered this, so i decided to find a solution.

I started buying with my debit card because that is still working, but after a while the fees really start adding up. If you don't care about that then perfect, this isn't for you.

Here's what i did.

* Open a free account with revolut (if you know more services like this leave it in the comments).
* Send money from bank account in local currency.
* open a euro account and convert the money.
* open up coinbase pro and click link new account.
* enter the BIC and IBAN numbers from your revolut euro account, and the bank name should be ""Revolut"".
* from the revolut app enter the CB bank info you get, and make sure that the reference number is correct.
* Make a test transaction and if you did everything right it should show up in a few minutes.
* after that you'll have it saved so you can just send right away and know it's the right info.

This cost me $0 to make the transfers and once everything is set up it's super simple. 

That being said i dont trust revolut, i would never keep my money in their account and i definitely wouldn't buy crypto on their platform.

I'm posting this because i had to spend a lot of time searching old threads on forums to figure everything out when my bank stopped my crypto habit.. Hope this helps you!

My hardware wallet BTC default is Legacy. I want to move my BTC from legacy to SegWit within the wallet.

I have received **25 different** transactions **into** this wallet and **0** transactions **out** of this wallet.

I am looking to pay the **least** amount of fees to do this. **I do not mind waiting** for the funds to arrive as I am not in any particular rush. However; **I would not like to process this transaction several times.**

The amount we are talking about moving is approximately 0.17 BTC.

If I feel that way, as a competent techie, what must the general public be thinking, who are not as adept in technology? They don't want this burden. I don't think they would accept it. I think they would want someone else to be responsible for it and for it to be guaranteed in some way by another who will do the dirty work or some other method of ensuring you can't lose it.

So will it take an older, non-technical generation simply dying off before full adoption? Will there be Bitcoin ""banks""? Will people just use Coinbase and the like? Isn't that sort of like a Bitcoin bank already?

Greetings fellow enthusiasts.  I’m relatively new to crypto (been in the game since October), but since then I’ve been learning and studying just about every day.  I’ve learned who the scammers are and who are the smart people I really trust in the space.  The overwhelming narrative I see is that bitcoin is a store of value, and if everything goes to plan it will eventually flip gold’s market cap which would put it at about $500,000 per bitcoin.  Some other bitcoin maxi’s say it will reach 5 million per coin but obviously there is no way to tell.  Obviously nothing is set in stone and crypto is insane but it seems like a relatively safe bet long term.  My question is this, would it be a smart move to DCA into bitcoin basically forever? Just as a working person might put $100 into an index fund every month until they retire? Isn’t it a reasonable bet that if I put 6k a year into bitcoin and not touch it for 10 years I could potentially do extremely well in the next 10-20 years?

So now back in 2021 I've finally decided to actually buy bitcoin and this time i was going to use my sister, I'm going to be honest and say that I tricked her into completing KYC without her knowing so I can buy bitcoin since i knew it was for the best and it was my own money

Well the conversation shifted to bitcoin one day and I eventually told her that I've tricked her and we agreed that I can make an account in her name and she'll give me some money too.

Great!It fuled my love for bitcoin even more.

Except that I've been the one studying about bitcoin, buying, using my own money and yet she acts like it's a team job and it's both of our money

She's a 25 year old college dropout living with my parents so she's got no money except for what my parents give to her but she said that we she'll go ahead and give some of that to me, I was fine with that, and i didn't think much
 of it until today

My mom sent her the money for all the stuff she has to pay for and the money for my braces appointment, she said she was going to give me money but she just told me that ""You know what you can use the money for your appointment and that's my part"", and at that point it clicked in and I thought about it

I'm the one investing all my money, I'm the one doing everything related to this, she knows about bitcoin only because some rich douchebag on Instagram got rich off of it so she thinks that bitcoin is an ATM where you throw money in and it comes out in doubles


I thought about the future and i realized that if this was going to keep going, I'm going to eventually get a job this summer and then I'll start investing maybe in the thousands but the account is in her name...

Bitcoin will triple, quadruple who knows and then what? She's going to ask for her cut even though she hasn't done shit and hasn't given me shit and then I'm left with two choices

1.Suck it up and give her half?More?Less?

2.Get into an argument and either end up in court where

a. I end up an asshole who priorities money over family
b.She wins and takes all the money

I don't want to end up with that choice, I know I'm thinking really ahead but i don't want to be put in that spot, what's a good option, I'm really looking for help

I'm really overestimating and overreacting with the court and everything but if this keeps going it'll possibly end that way and I'd rather find a solution to all of this now then to suck it up later

its wonderfull and beautiful and all and its unfortunetly outofdate in comparision of cryptocurrency ecosystem today which would be a much more fun and complicated topic of discussion. But that introduction alone deserves the unparamount recognizion of questionably the most well put and well founded underground call to arms in the history of economic rebellion.

Combined with the unparelled tools of computer science technologies, and a genius who built a foundation to a much bigger vision he clearly hoped to see thrive in the futures. And finally put to sleep the abysmal catastrophies caused by very niche structers that hold together and make possible the ongoing natures of globally widespread economic consolidations and their dustributed systems of economic abuse, financial comexities, economic instabilities, and unregulated juggling acts we utilize to achieve our clearly broken as hell upholding of what we only know how to keep going. and its the unfortunate duel edged currency competetion that fuels the races all in all.

His vision was simply to create a decentralized financial environment, because the author and every damn one of you who have studied financial history knows that the story is the same all throughout history. 

power or desire of, atracts wealth. and wealth attracts influence. Influence attracts power and then the attractor ends up in the middle of the circle. with a revolving density we call historically well i call it, the concentration of the god of civilivations, most just say money. 

Buisness, politics, sports, ANY hierarchy or/AND financially incentiviced distrubutions of wealth systems are in constant realtional tandum. 

And just like everything else in economics alone or anything elsewhere, we strive for growth and balance in any area of life. Be it as a gardner, a plummer, a buisness man, a buissness, a bank, a country, a world.
The key is and what the only goal is is balance, because balance promotes self sufficency on every level there is available to it. It promotes health and innovation because the artful man knows conflict always flees from balance, and with conflict goes many avoided troubles and many hours spent dealing with them. Leaving room for expansion rather than problem solving.

I am relatively new to btc and only hold about .015btc that I purchased a few weeks ago. I have been doing a bit of research lately and am STRONGLY considering purchasing 1 btc and locking it away for a long time.

That said, I am having trouble finding a strong (or well thought out) bear case. Lots of outlets seem to just rage some version of ""bitcoin is stupid, it isnt real, people who like bitcoin are stupid, its a bubble"".

The fact that these corrections - which are large comparable to stocks and other assets - happen regularly to the point that it is an expected, even celebrated occurrence in the world of Bitcoin, to me, this is the strongest evidence that Bitcoin is not ""one big bubble"". If you disagree with me, please explain why I'm wrong - I'm very eager to develop a better understanding of this.  


Does Bitcoin's price get ahead of itself sometimes following positive news, to the point that it is temporarily over-valued? Of course. And this naturally creates opportune selling points for whales, traders, and folks that have already made 10X+... yet as the price dips and dips, it has always reached an equilibrium point where the world rushes in to buy the discount - because the world recognizes Bitcoin as a valuable and desired asset. Over time, I believe these dips help shape a more even (that is, uniform) distribution of Bitcoin among those that hold the asset, as the long-time holders and whales give up their disproportionately-accumulated Bitcoin, and the resulting buying opportunities allow this to distribute this BTC more evenly among the rest of the crypto-nerds.

I don't fully understand the swirl of market forces that generate these corrections, and perhaps my outlook is a bit naïve. But I'm starting to think these dips are a natural part of Bitcoin's growth curve that actually protect the asset in the long-run.",Bitcoin

I have attached email conversations with their customer care executives and the do not have a clue.

People should be aware of the risk they take when they store their crypto on their exchange.

17 Mar 2021

Claims process

Since the Claims portal was launched in early December 2020, we have sent an email to all 960,000 account holders who had positive account balances according to Cryptopia’s Records. Over 57% by value of account holders have interacted with us in some way. The claims process is still at stage 1 of the below process:

**ProcessDetails**1. Claims registrationAllows the registration of account holders' details and to make claims for their account balances2. Identity verificationVerifies account holders' identities to the necessary verification standard3. Asset transferInstigates asset transfers to account holders

* While we have a significant number of claimants registering successfully, we appreciate that there are also a number who require support to complete the registration process. This is reflected by the number of tickets being raised through our customer support portal. We have taken on additional support staff to assist account holders to complete the registration process. We assure you that we will action all outstanding tickets prior to moving to stage 3 of the process.
* If you are having issues with the registration please refer to the [**‘Update for Cryptopia Claimants &amp; Common Portal Errors 16 December 2020'**](https://www.grantthornton.co.nz/insights/update-for-cryptopia-claimants--common-portal-errors-16-december-2020/).
* We intend to carry out a further promotion of the portal to accountholders to encourage increased participation and will send a further email inviting account holders to register their details on the portal. We have received a number of emails and calls from account holders claiming that they had not received an email. In the majority of cases we were able to confirm to the account holders that they had received an email. Please double check your email spam folder to check whether you have been contacted.
* The next stage of the claim process 2 ‘Identity verification’ will be launched in the next couple of months, with the asset transfer stage to follow on from this. However, the transfer stage will require the input and approval of the Court particularly in relation to the following:  

   * Approving a distribution model that reflects the nature of stakeholders’ property
   * Confirming what is to be done with unclaimed Crypto-assets
   * Setting a cut-off date for claims to be received and assessed

Sealed orders

* In this update we provide service of orders in respect of realisation of digital assets. We have received orders allowing us to convert 80 BTC into fiat currency to meet the reasonable cost and expenses of and incidental to the protection, preservation, recovery, management, and administration of any Cryptocurrency.
* [**A copy of the sealed orders can be found here \[ 614 kb \]**](https://www.grantthornton.co.nz/globalassets/1.-member-firms/new-zealand/pdfs/cryptopia/2021/sealed-orders61013359.1.pdf).

This is so that at least miners can earn transaction fees once all coins are eventually mined out (2140?).

As block rewards reduce exponentially (as early as 2038) how would bitcoin encourage people to continue mining in order to maintain the security of the network? Reduced difficulty and miners just means a 51% attack is just around the corner. That is not a lot of security to store value. And if bitcoin is worth so much in the future, who would incur gigantic fees just to use the main layer and perform transactions?

The complicated way how cryptos work scares off a lot of people - why would they invest in something they dont understand. On top of that, cryptos being used for illegal stuff (drugs), using hell a lot of energy - does not help. I asked myself why bother.
But recently I opened trading account for stocks / ETF, and started following much more financial situation in US / EU. The global crisis for sure helped opening my eyes - governments printing money like it was a toilet paper. Then the stock market - endless machine of growth, and gambling for adults. I never really thought about it before (cause I had no money to invest). Why the hell is everyone investing in the stock market (or rather every rich guy)? Because money is freaking worthless, whatever currency. You let it sit in your bank and your are basically getting robbed, silently, but steadily every god damn year.
So I figured - gotta put money into stock-market, and so I did. But then I finally though about crypto again. And then it made sense - hedge against that useless currency (USD / EUR). Get something no one has control over. No rich guys, no god damn governments. Bitcoin seemed like made-up artificial thing before - but normal money is too in the end.

t3_m69kkb,Unbank the Banks.,"Man, this is going to be a rant.This is my frustration with traditional banking system.

I approached 2 brick and mortar bank i.e. Deutsche and Sparkasse in Germany to ""**inquire**"" about opening a business account. Mind you not the account opening state just to weigh which would be better.I have a crypto side hustle which I want to get incorporated. So I am in the process of collecting information.

Following is my experience:Deutsche bank: I have an account here, so it was my first choice to ask.We need proof. So I say ok , what kind of proofs you need.  (I know I have to show payout from mining or whatever, I have it).

My colleague will get back to you. It's been a month and **NO ONE** has got back to me.

Sparkasse:

Well glad Germany has more banks, so I go to Sparkasse as one fellow redditor [recommend](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/m4r8da/bank_recognised_my_btc_when_getting_a_mortgage/gqwlmhs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)them to be not crypto hostile.

So I show up with a list of questions in my hand. The person I interacted with was really friendly but she had very limited knowledge, so she rings up her colleague and the person on the other end, boy what do I say about her. To begin with ""DO YOUR FUCKING JOB YOU ARE BEING PAID FOR"".She right up said , NO. Ask him to go to his own bank and open account there. I mean I was there just to ask for the procedure and what facilities they provide. They just gave me a piece of paper and said read it yourself.I mean these are private banks, but employees don't give a fck about potential customers.

I understand they have a right to refuse service if they don't want. but **THIS IS THE BARRIER TO ENTRY.**

And **THIS IS WHY WE NEED BITCOIN.**

Imagine the opportunity cost I would suffer if I had to go through traditional banking system to setup my business and running around and being at their mercy.

Rant over.TLDR: Went to bank to ask about business account and they won't even answer questions of a potential client.

We’ll use one of our [Mining Insights Profitability Calculator](https://insights.braiins.com/profitability-calculator) to illustrate why miners should not be thought of purely as “sellers of BTC” who suppress price increases. **Miners are HODLers too.**

**Scenario #1:**

[insights.braiins.com](https://preview.redd.it/euovy2xrien61.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d24e1fd52cd59de0b7fdc5799e04e1195cd9297)

☝️ This chart is an 18-month cash flow visualization for a miner with 6.8 PH/s of hashrate, all S17 Pros.

Bull market parameters:

\- Difficulty increases 4%/month 

\- Price increases 6.5%/month

In this projection, the miner sells all BTC into fiat each month and has an **end profit: $1.1MM**

**Scenario #2:**

[insights.braiins.com](https://preview.redd.it/lqjgn7msien61.png?width=952&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ea9f80590959f245069897c171987a1acaaaf6c)

☝️ This chart is for the exact same miner and all of the exact same inputs, with **one difference:**

**HODL Ratio = 100%**

All profits are kept in BTC instead of selling to fiat and the miner ends with an **end profit: $1.9MM**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We added the HODL Ratio input to our Profitability Calculator in order to make it more useful based on  [The Intelligent Bitcoin Miner](https://www.aniccaresearch.tech/blog/the-intelligent-bitcoin-miner-part-i), a report from Annica Research. It's a must read for understanding the evolution of the BTC mining industry.

t3_m6sacj,Short Positions,"There is a lot of short positions being taken during this sell off, and some are probably making some good money.  You can tell because of the price action.  When BTC crosses a $1000 boundary, tons of covers come in.  If it were regular buyers they would have bought at the lower prices, not waterfalls coming in right on the mark.  Some of these shorts probably have decent leverage and once the market direction switches with confidence things will be much different.  Whenever there is an event in a market which causes a decline, shorts take advantage and they move in like sharks to keep the sentiment downward and the price action going down, triggering stops, and causing more sell offs.  

Sure there is some legit panic selling, but a lot of it is shorts.  The volume and price action do not leave any other explanation.",Bitcoin

Historical price movements transposed on to current market behavior will not affect my DCA strategy, to preface, and I feel I would personally benefit from dips in the future. 

But I just learned what a “halving” is. I’ve known about bitcoin for nearly 10 years, when my friend first introduced me to it along with the SR. 

The new ATHs and market proving made me research more. I don’t feel unique in this.

I am expecting that many more (meaning at some point, a growing proportion) people will be looking at bitcoin as an asset with a 4 year lo a maturation period. In this way, future halvings will be priced in and ease some of the interim volatility. There is a general tendency in markets that the more money is involved, the longer horizons tend to be considered. 

Today, there’s an order of magnitude more people who are aware of the price action following halvings. The pricing in of this expectation beforehand, I believe, is going to occur and significantly reduce inter year volatility before the market has to contend in a more “raw” way with the supply side limits on circulation.

I was notified in October 2020 that I needed to transfer all of my crypto assets out of my binance account and into a [binance.us](https://binance.us) account by the end of the year which I promptly did. What I didn't realize was that Binance would then block online access to to my original account once the assets were withdrawn. Now I can't access the account to view my transaction history and can't fill out the crypto transaction history for my 2020 taxes.

Binance has been very slow on account verification (they took TWO MONTHS to verify my new [binance.us](https://binance.us) account) and customer service and I am afraid they will not respond to my request until after the tax deadline.

Does anyone have any recommendations on how I could retrieve these transactions without the help of Binance?",Bitcoin

t3_m6hozw,What is the Fundamental Case for Bitcoin?,"I'm willing to be persuaded and I don't mean to be an asshole, I'm just asking the question.

However, it seems to me that if we are entering a new monetary era, some currencies will be competitive on the basis of their usefulness, security, privacy, transaction and storage ease, etc.  Some other currencies may be competitive based on their ties to real world assets and uses.  For instance, I think USD will have value as long as the government can through you in prison for tax evasion and crypto backed by precious metals will have value corresponding to those assets.

I just don't see where Bitcoin fits in.  There are other cryptocurrencies and asset classes that seem to do everything that Bitcoin does, but much better.

Bitcoin may be the first mover, but if eventually we are going to have an accessible and open market for currencies, where does Bitcoin compete? I guess network effects matter, but if the exchanges keep allowing people to exchange a variety of cryptocurrencies, aren't those undermined?

Even if Bitcoin is widely adopted and for example, businesses figure out how to use it in everyday transactions, aren't they also basically figuring how to use every other crypto as well?

I'm sure Bitcoin will end up being of historical importance in some way, but is it really built for the future?

Now it's time for a recap &amp; update on development + adoption 👇

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade](https://preview.redd.it/oqq4kyhm30m61.png?width=1199&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb28be028fff3a67534abd209e8d1e009a8315e1)

**For those not familiar** with the features of Stratum V2 or how it compares to Stratum V1 &amp; BetterHash, we have [an overview](https://braiins.com/bitcoin-mining-stack-upgrade) for you (check the Compare tab for more). It also includes a Q&amp;A with protocol authors [Matt Corallo](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt), [Jan Capek](https://twitter.com/janbraiins) and [Pavel Moravec](https://twitter.com/mor_pav).

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/upgrade\/compare-mining-protocols](https://preview.redd.it/lfabnz5z30m61.png?width=1108&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0deab79ca092c68515e9c8af5f5492c88c4f1b6)

**DECENTRALIZATION:**

While all of the features are relevant to miners &amp; mining pools, the **aspect of Stratum V2 that most non-miner Bitcoiners care about is Job Negotiation**. This is a sub-protocol that enables miners to construct their own blocks, a task currently only being done by pools.

We recommend the following piece from [Karim Helmy](https://twitter.com/karimhelpme) (R&amp;D at [Coinmetrics](https://twitter.com/coinmetrics)) which includes an explanation of out-of-band payments, a potential economic incentive for miners to adopt Job Negotiation.

&gt;[Deribit Insights](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/stratum-v2-migration-and-decentralization/): ""Stratum V2: Migration and Decentralization""

We also have a deeper explanation of how Stratum V2 can impact Bitcoin's decentralization and how the Job Negotiation process works. Approximately 94% of Bitcoin's hashrate currently goes through Chinese mining pools, while some \~65% is physically produced in China during the rainy season. Safe to say, **Bitcoin decentralization isn't perfect. TL;DR: Stratum V2 can help** ⬇️

&gt;""[Bitcoin’s Decentralization with Stratum V2](https://braiins.com/blog/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization)""

[https:\/\/braiins.com\/blog\/stratum-v2-bitcoin-decentralization](https://preview.redd.it/vo0x4d1m50m61.png?width=862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d12daa1f9f8dc2f10b861759d8f465a08eb0b442)

**ADOPTION:**

So, what is the state of Stratum V2 adoption today?  Well, it's still very early days. We have an implementation on r/slushpool and in our [Braiins OS+](https://braiins.com/os/plus) firmware, so there are already many miners using V2. However, this doesn't include Job Negotiation yet...

The reason is that **there are changes necessary in Bitcoin Core** in order to make Job Negotiation possible. So there can't be a full implementation of Stratum V2 until those changes are made. Good news: **the development is in progress with a help from Square Crypto!**

[Wohoo!](https://preview.redd.it/ondex2so70m61.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5747c121987bb40adfd5240af5ef4dabc7bdd2c3)

Until then, mining pools will remain the sole entities constructing blocks to add to the Bitcoin blockchain. However, **miners can still benefit from partial V2 implementations** which improve efficiency, privacy, and security (e.g. man-in-the-middle attack prevention). 

We believe **Stratum V2 will have a significant long-term impact** on the mining industry, particularly as transaction fees account for an increasing proportion of mining revenue. 

We'll be sure to update the community again as the development progresses.",Bitcoin

t3_m7vge3,A warning to others I lost $5000 to a scam utterly embarrassed and ashamed to share this but hopefully it might save another,"

I had £5000 GBP that I had saved and I was determined to finally try make something of my money.

I spent weeks learning how to read charts/technical analysis and as I became more confident I wanted to learn further. I have $6900 spread across some reasonably safe coin but no greed got the better of me...

I was following JRNY Crypto since I got into this mid Feb. He was always talking about his memberships and I became really curious and wanted to get involved.

I saw him post a message on Twitter about his membership commenting on what one of his subscribers had said. I was convinced this would be a good decision. 

So later that day I messaged JRNY crypto... or atleast... I thought I did... 

Earlier that day I followed someone called @JRNYcryptto 


i didn’t realise the extra T I messaged this guy and expressed my desire to join his membership program we actually had a good conversation he broke down the different types of membership and I was sold he directed me to this trading platform 

Bitcryptotrade.net

Because I messaged him first there were no red flags.. I thought the trading platform looked a bit crappy but still no red flags... I head to the subscription page where I deposited 5 grand... saying it out loud and reading as I type is making me feel utterly sick that I could be so fucking retarded....

The premise was that he would trade with my funds and after he had achieved the certain ROI he’d take 20% and I would take the rest. Like you pay a an investment banker. I had sunk a few whiskies earlier in the evening which I knew clouded my judgement..

It wasn’t until after I had deposited.. that I felt the urge to check something... I remember in a JRNY video he was aiming for 100k Twitter following. I went back on Twitter and noticed this guy had 20k.. dread filled my soul I then noticed the extra T..

I knew at that moment I was never seeing a single penny of that money ever again.... I brought this new discovery to his attention. He claimed he has a second account so that he can message prospects. I knew it was total bullshit but I was worried that he had some of my info and I was nervous this could get worse..

He kept reassuring me this was real and I should relax.. a few days later he aggressively try’s to convince me that I had to pay his 20% commission fee upfront I couldn’t  believe the balls of this guy... I told him that wasn’t gonna happen I had very little left basically $1700 from my original £5000..

He then try’s to befriend me saying not to worry about the fee and continued to try reassure me.. I went along with it due to worries he may be able to hack my wallet to retrieve my last few coins. Lastly he says for me to withdraw my profits at the end of day 5 I’d need to pay a $5000 withdrawal fee. 

Neither the commission fee or withdrawal fee was ever mentioned prior to me depositing funds. He tried to take advantage of the fact I was all in and tried to exploit another 11 grand out of me. Not once was I ever going to pay..

I thought I was a smart guy but I’m a dumb fucking idiot who deserved all of this. To make matters worse I have been bombarded by fund recovery scammers...

I have only a tiny bit left and every day I’m lying to my partner about how my crypto investing is going..

For the love of god don’t be as retarded as me please read this, feel free to laugh and ridicule I deserve it... read this and remember even if you think you’re talking to a legitimate person with good intentions even  if YOU message them first...

They will rob you and go broke.,"If this applies to you, seriously what are you thinking? We’ve been shouting “don’t buy BTC on RH” from the rooftops. The latest update is finding out that RH has admitted to paper trading $GME and fucking investors when their naked positions caught a 3 billion dollar margin call.

If this had been a Bitcoin related event, there would have been no recovery, RH would have filed for bankruptcy and relied on their elite friends to manage any government intervention that may crop up.

 RH basically shorted every order their client’s made, not only stabbing those clients in the back short term, but setting them up to lose everything if they were right. If $GME had gone to $1,000 some of these folks would have been left with less than their buy-in because RH would have gone under.

Returning to Bitcoin, it’s important to understand that this deceptive practice is even more easily perpetrated against RH’s BTC buyers and that Congress / regulators are even less likely to do anything about it.

For the love of Satoshi, I know at least one of you reading this is still not selling the Bitcoin you have on RH, transferring your fiat to a legitimate exchange, rebuying the Bitcoin, and storing it off exchange. Stupid games, stupid prizes, and you can’t be entirely dumb if you’ve read this far. Make the move right now and sleep better knowing your coins are safe and so is the integrity of the Bitcoin ecosystem. 

Other exchanges to consider include: Gemini, Kraken, Binance US, Coinsebase Pro, Swan, and if you’re a real legend BISQ. 

If this is your first time hearing this stuff, search r/Bitcoin for Robinhood and checkout this recent r/wallstreetbets thread detailing RH’s 3 billion dollar margin call https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m74e3g/this_is_huge_robinhood_never_owned_your_gme/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf

TL:DR - RH probably isn’t buying Bitcoin when you buy Bitcoin on RH. If Bitcoin rallies hard enough, or if RH has an internal problem, you’re likely to lose everything. Move your funds off of RH.",Bitcoin

t3_m7odic,Inflation is the silent killer of human purchasing power.," ***The main driver of Bitcoin's growth in the coming year will not be the policy of abundant stimulation of the economy conducted by the Fed, but inflation. And although many do not see real inflation in the United States, it is growing rapidly in the rest of the world.***

https://preview.redd.it/qs8axr8iqrn61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70f902a1b416a2472c37d4fb95504a7e45c22044

Alex Gladstein, chief strategic director of the Foundation for Human Rights, [said](https://news.bitcoin.com/1-2-billion-people-live-under-double-digit-inflation-many-have-found-escape-in-bitcoin-says-hrfs-alex-gladstein/) that *1.2 billion of the world's citizens live in inflation that reaches two to three digits.*

**Inflation is the silent killer of human purchasing power.**

Over the past week, a number of analysts and economists have discussed a possible rise in US inflation, mainly due to the huge volumes of stimulus created in 2020 and 2021. This has led economists to believe that inflation will soon come to the US as the Federal Reserve is cornered by plans to keep the easy money schemes for 2021.

The biggest sell-off of US government bonds in recent history is a direct harbinger of inflation. And although the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds rose from 0.9% to 1.6%, this cannot suit investors watching how the stock market and the bitcoin market grow. It even ""*led to the worst quarter for Treasury investors in more than four years*,"" according to Ice Data Services.

Bob Prince, the hedge fund manager of the Bridgewater Associates, [warned](https://news.bitcoin.com/hedge-fund-manager-says-sell-off-in-us-treasury-bonds-a-threat-to-high-flying-assets-like-btc/) that the recent sell-off in the US government bond market could accelerate and it could “threaten high-yielding assets” such as cryptocurrencies and companies with negative earnings.

However, more than 1.2 billion people living in countries with double-digit inflation do not have access to high-quality assets, but they have easy access to one global asset that does not require special knowledge or licenses. And this asset is bitcoin. People simply have nowhere to go, no one agitates them to buy bitcoin. They are forced to do it.

If the fears of Ice Data Services analysts and large institutional investors come true, and the sale of American Treasuries continues in the current quarter, then it will be very difficult to avoid inflation in the US. In this case, large American investors will simply have nowhere to go. They will be forced to hedge the risks of depreciating Bitcoin assets.

Another important indirect confirmation of the real threat of inflation is the position of the main economic media. In particular, Bloomberg Economics editor Peter Coy wrote an editorial titled ""[Tune Out the Hyperinflation Hype](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-04/why-hyperinflation-won-t-happen-in-u-s-like-in-venezuela-or-zimbabwe)"", portraying investor concerns as ""hype"" and manifestation of ""conspiracy theory."" Coy even noted that fear of inflation only helps drive the price of BTC. A number of other media outlets, as if on cue, have released similar articles claiming that the fear of inflation is all fiction and conspiracy theories.

However, according to the latest Bank of America (BoA) poll, which surveyed 220 fund managers with more than $ 630 billion in assets, “inflation” is the largest risk for the markets, outweighing all other risks, including Covid-19.

When doing a fundamental analysis of Bitcoin price movements in the first half of 2021, you should first look at two things: the sale of American Treasuries and the real inflation rate in the United States. *There are the answers to the question about the next peaks in the price of bitcoin.*",Bitcoin

t3_m8bls5,Positive Prospect of BitCoin’s Future,"**一．** **The Development Process of Bitcoin**

Almost a week has passed since March 12, the trend of Bitcoin has risen unprecedentedly.

Reviewing the development of Bitcoin, Bitcoin was developed in January 2009, then quickly developed and slowly began to gain a certain degree of popularity in the market. From the black swan plunge on March 12th, 2020 to the increasing on March 12th, 2021, the development of Bitcoin in the past year has made us more firmly aware of the positive trend of Bitcoin in the future.

**二．** **The Black Swan on March, 12th 2020**

On the eve before March 12th, 2020, influenced by Covid-19, the panic hit the global financial market. China’s market, U.S. stocks, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and other markets collapsed collectively. Influenced at the background of the US's massive printing to rescue the market, the global financial market gradually entered a stable.

From March 8th to March 13th in the year 2020, Bitcoin~~s~~ pushed down from $9,000. In less than a week, the lowest once fell to $3800. The total liquidation was over $50 billion. Bitcoins encountered a liquidity crisis, major exchanges collectively shut down the service, and investors were extremely pessimistic, believing that the Cryptocurrency market would collapse.

However, opportunities and despair coexist. Bitcoin dropped to 3,800 dollars and then quickly REBOUNDED After more than a month of slow climbing, Bitcoin once again broke the MA60 which is also called the bull-bear boundary, and returned to be above $9,000. After the third halving of Bitcoin, its scarcity has become more obvious. The influx of a large number of institutions has boosted Bitcoin's further strength, creating an unprecedented super bull market. 

Lucian, the chief analyst of BitOffer Exchange, said that in fact, the cryptocurrency market has undergone earth-shaking changes in the past year. The most important thing is that institutions enter the market to maintain the overall stability of the market, which means that predicting schemes are hard to arrange anymore.

Before the Bitcoin breakthrough to $20,000 happened, Bitcoin~~s~~ always kept up and down. After buying, HODL always brought a loss. There is a saying in the cryptocurrency market, that is, nowadays there seems rarely to appear the ups and downs state, which thanks to the entry of international investment banking institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Grayscale, Fidelity, and Citigroup, as well as the public purchase of a large number of listed companies, the overall stability of the market has been improved, which also shows that the Cryptocurrency market is gradually maturing.

**三．** **BitCoin went up to $60,000 on March 12th, 2021**

On March, 12th, 2021. the BTC went up to $60,000. (According to the data on the image).

The Black Swan made more investors extremely pessimistic. On March, 12th, 2021, the BTC continued to rise, breaking through the unprecedented $60,000 USD. The curse of“Black Swan” on March 12, 2021, has been removed.

This is mainly due to the following reasons:

On March 7th,2021, Biden failed his plan to stimulate $1.9 trillion. It means there will amount of cash going into the crypto market. The buying treasures of investors will be beneficial to make a historic breakthrough in Bitcoins. Therefore, there is no need for investors to take more care about the coming of March 12th. At present, the upward trend of Bitcoin remains very good. If there is a corresponding correction in the short term, it is still a good entry point. In terms of the general trend, we believe that Bitcoin will rise to more than $100,000 this year.

**四．** **Earn Profits according to the uptrend of BitCoins**

According to the data of BitOffer, the global crypto investors tend to buy Bitcoin’s ETF funds for the reasons that Bitcoin’s ETF funds support buying the ups and downs of Bitcoins and costs free fees and free liquidation. The profits of ETF funds are 3-17 times higher than spot trading. So it is the best way to buy ETF funds. Now the market value scale of Bitoffer platform investors is more than US$1 billion. 

As for the leveraged ETF fund, there are obvious advantages that the ETF fund has free deposit and fees and no liquidation and can enjoy high profits of 3 times to 17 times. Lucian said BitOffer’s leveraged ETF fund will gradually replace the contrast of the current market.

**五．** **The future of BitOffer’s BitCoin can be in high expectation.**

Bitoffer developed new products for DOT、LINK、UNI、SUSHI. Lucian said most of any other mainstream currency and DeFi currency would be developed to satisfy the needs of crypto market investors. Now it is very active in leveraged ETF Fund trading. Especially in the primary subscription market, the total monthly subscription volume exceeded $1 billion, which is even much higher than the spot transaction volume.",Bitcoin

The point being... no one knew! Lots of people sold around this time. You simply cannot beat yourself up for cashing out when it felt right. You can’t dwell on the past. 

In late 2017, I started building my btc holdings back up. I have been buying consistently for the last 4 years and have yet to sell a single satoshi!

    Bitcoin mining is voluntary and bitcoin miners only mine bitcoin to make a profit and they turn off their miners when it's no longer profitable for them to mine. Bitcoin mining will use substantially less electricity by summer of 2032 because the block reward will be just 0.78125 BTC and the mining difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks which is approximately two weeks. This is just a small part of [bitcoin protocol rules](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_rules) that Satoshi created.

    In 2019, [the bitcoin network was getting 74.1% of its electricity from renewables](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/18/18642645/bitcoin-energy-price-renewable-china), making it “more renewables-driven than almost every other large-scale industry in the world.” In 2021, it will be using even more renewables and that only increases with time.

    [Here's a full report on bitcoin mining that was done in 2019](https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-december-2019), one year before mining started in Mongolia in 2020 which was banned this year.

    There was a Cambridge study done on bitcoin mining in 2020 but 2020 is exactly when bitcoin miners set up shop in the Mongolian region of China and started using electricity generated from coal but that only lasted less than a year because the [Chinese government has now banned bitcoin mining in that region of China and they also banned mining bitcoin with dirty energy](https://www.coindesk.com/inner-mongolia-to-shut-down-crypto-mining-industry-report) and now bitcoin can be mined with mainly clean renewable energy once again like it previously was.

    Dirty energy just can't compete with clean renewable energy like [hydroelectric power which they get as low as 1 cent a kilowatt hour.](https://news.bitcoin.com/1-cent-per-kilowatt-hour-chinas-sichuan-province-encourages-hydro-powered-bitcoin-mining)

    Perhaps we should worry about video games or youtube because [video games and youtube use more electricity than bitcoin](https://i.redd.it/ncmwuesezrg61.jpg) and we all know that's residential electricity so most of that energy doesn't come from renewable resources. Humans really need to generate more renewable energy and rely less on dirty energy. I'm glad that [large scale bitcoin mining is driving clean energy innovation](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-large-scale-bitcoin-mining-is-driving-clean-energy-innovation-2021-01-06) because the world really needs it at this time, much like we needed scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked, that is, before Satoshi created bitcoin for us.

    Bitcoin is currently at the second stage of the evolution of money which is a store of value. Gold is currently the #1 largest asset on earth by market cap because it's used by humans as a store of value and it has been for centuries. Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold and it's much easier send, protect, and hide and it's also more scarce than gold. Gold mining and transporting gold are both far worse for the environment than mining bitcoin and transporting bitcoin. Gold mining emits more than three times the co2 emissions than bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold and bitcoin can also be used for payments and as currency and the lightning network allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for extremely low fees, and it can handle hundreds of millions of transactions per second. [Click here to see a list of the top 100 assets by market cap.](https://8marketcap.com/) Gold is #1 with a market cap of $11 trillion and bitcoin is #8 with a market cap of $1 trillion. Almost all of that value sitting in gold being inefficiently stored and guarded in vaults can more easily and efficiently be stored on the bitcoin blockchain and more people will continue to realize this as bitcoin continues to remain at the second stage of the evolution of money which is a store of value.

    [This bar graph](https://i.redd.it/wv4bfba5p4h61.jpg) shows the energy expenditure and yearly cost of gold mining and bitcoin mining.

    This isn't the second millennium anymore and we have better technology now. Gold is just too inefficient and bad for the environment for people to be using as a store of value anymore and if we stopped doing that then the price would come down to it's true value and it would be extremely cheap for the minuscule amount that we do use in electronics, thus lowering the price of electronics. Gold is shiny and makes pretty jewelry and also makes great corrosion resistant semiconductors. It's difficult and expensive to transport and it requires equipment to reliably test it's authenticity. It's also difficult and expensive to adequately guard and protect. All of the value of gold could sit on the blockchain instead of sitting in a vault being guarded and it also wouldn't need to be transported in a jet in order to transfer it to someone.

    Bitcoin's blockchain is layer 1 and is used for large payments/settlements/transactions and the lightning network is bitcoin's layer 2 and is used for smaller instant payments/transactions. People are transferring $500M+ worth of bitcoin, half the time over a $billion worth of bitcoin, [in every single block](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/blocks), all day, every day. The lightning network can handle an unlimited amount of users and hundreds of millions of transactions per second which is magnitudes more transactions than visa/mastercard can handle. 

    **Money always evolves in the following four stages:**

    **1. Collectible:** In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads, and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.

    **2. Store of value:** Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.

    **3. Medium of exchange:** When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange. In the earliest days of Bitcoin, many people did not appreciate the huge opportunity cost of using bitcoins as a medium of exchange, rather than as an incipient store of value. The famous story of a man trading 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas illustrates this confusion.

    **4. Unit of account:** When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. That is, the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods. It is a common misconception that bitcoin prices are available for many goods today. For example, while a cup of coffee might be available for purchase using bitcoins, the price listed is not a true bitcoin price; rather it is the dollar price desired by the merchant translated into bitcoin terms at the current USD/BTC market exchange rate. If the price of bitcoin were to drop in dollar terms, the number of bitcoins requested by the merchant would increase commensurately. Only when merchants are willing to accept bitcoins for payment without regard to the bitcoin exchange rate against fiat currencies can we truly think of Bitcoin as having become a unit of account.

t3_m79l3c,Bitcoin's fair launch cannot ever be replicated by another cryptocurrency,"I created this thread to point out some distinct and important differences between the launch of bitcoin compared to the launch of every other cryptocurrency. I realize that many of you already know these facts, but some of you don't.

Bitcoin, the most secure and decentralized cryptocurrency (I'm not debating it), was created to solve the problem of trust with governments and to be a store of value that can be sent/received anywhere/anytime without permission or trust of anyone else. Bitcoin’s narrative matches the real world utility. If you want to get technical, bitcoin is really a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked. 

**To ensure that the launch was considered fair, Satoshi took careful steps to make sure that the world would look back and observe that bitcoin was launched fairly:**

- **No premine** (Satoshi didn’t grant himself any coins)
- **Gave a 2 month heads up before launching the network** (no sudden release and no mining before release)
- **Coins had no value for 1.5 years so they circulated freely** (this cannot even be replicated)
- **Satoshi never cashed out** (unlike every other founder in history and I bet it stays that way for eternity)

Putting everything else about bitcoin aside, there will never be another cryptocurrency that is launched as fairly as bitcoin, for all of eternity, because bitcoin's fair launch cannot ever be replicated. Now that the genies out of the bottle and bitcoin is here, it's 100% impossible to ever have a cryptocurrency where the coins are circulating in the wild freely for 18 months before having any value. I also don't think that we'll ever see another cryptocurrency created where the founder never cashes out.",Bitcoin

t3_m7t5q1,[App] Blitzcoin - Trade your stuff for crypto currency.,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I just published an app, that many of you might be interested in. So let me introduce you to Blitzcoin 😉

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, there's no ""real"" place, where crypto-folks like us, can exchange products/services for crypto currency.

Sure there is craigslist, which offers this as an option, but craigslist is not used worldwide. Most countries have their own ""craigslist"" clone, but not all of them offer an option for crypto currencies.

&amp;#x200B;

**That's where Blitzcoin comes in.**

&amp;#x200B;

Blitzcoin's main focus is to give people a place to offer products/services exclusevily for crypto currency. As of right now, Bitcoin is the main currency for exchange, which may be extended in the future to include other currencies as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

In it's current version, Blitzcoin offers the majority of core functionalities (add products/services, searching for products/services, messaging, etc...), thoroughly tested and fully working. The UI follows a simple and minimalistic approach, for ease of use.

&amp;#x200B;

Blitzcoin does not offer transactions. But depending on the success of the app, and your feedback, this and additional features can be implemented in future releases.

&amp;#x200B;

**Feel free to get it for your device:**

&amp;#x200B;

iOS:

[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blitzcoin/id1553313382](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blitzcoin/id1553313382)

&amp;#x200B;

Android:

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.blitzcoin.app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.blitzcoin.app)

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions or feedback, let me know in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

**Some FAQs you also might be interested in**

&amp;#x200B;

Q: The app asks for my location, why?

A: Since it's meant to be a worldwide release, it shows you products within a range of your current location.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Why is nothing showing up?

A: It's because I decided to launch the app without fake-data! So, if you're one of the first in your region to install the app, just wait a few days ( or weeks/months depending on the success of the app) until there are offerings near you, or go ahead and create an offering.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: What about privacy and terms?

A: [https://blitzcoin.biz/privacy/](https://blitzcoin.biz/privacy/)

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Everything is so slow, some features aren't even working, why's that?

A: It's because the app went viral, and neither I nor the infrastructure were prepared for that 😂",Bitcoin

As a reference point, about 95% of total Bitcoin is owned by the top 2.4% of addresses with the largest balances.

A small set of total accounts owns a massive portion of Bitcoin, leaving the asset vulnerable to sharp price swings on account of movements in these “whale” accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

I have some information about cryptos in general and a lot of faith in them, but I still have some concerns.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The amount of BTC is limited: 21 million will ever be produced. -&gt; People lose access to their secret keys. -&gt; The amount of ""usuable"" BTC decreases -&gt; What happens if all coins or most of them are lost? Doesn't it mean that BTC is already bound to fail?
2. Fees. In the future miners will have no more BTC to mine. -&gt; They will be more concentrated on transaction fees -&gt; Fees for a transaction will go up -&gt; What stops this fees from going up to e.g. 500000% of the amount to transferred itself?

I'm starting to realize a big issue-most of my friends are ignorant people, but they think that they are smart/special. Many make incomes of $150-250k/yr, and some have the general things many would associate with success. Ages are mid 30s to early 40s.

Through the last 6 months, I've realized in my conversations about bitcoin the vast majority of people don't give a rats ass about educating themselves or learning. It's about going to the bar, sports, and things that I would think many would grow out of. A lack of curiosity weirds me out.

One of my friends said he wanted to buy a house and then rented a $3500/month apartment.

Many others who I viewed as successful, when bringing up bitcoin, had a reaction of ""tulips"". I think bitcoin is attracting all sorts, but it attracts a lot of inquisitive people.

I think most people as long as they feel safe will block their eyes and ears to what is possibly happening here.

How many ""new"" millionaires are there from just these alone? And even deeper - given the way society ""was"".. how many normal people would have even had opportunities to be millionaires prior to these events?

t3_m7wmni,Seeking Yield Amid a Global Debt Bubble,"The Real Vision Crypto Interview: Jason Leibowitz, CEO and co-founder of [LeboBTC Ledger Group (LLG)](https://www.lebobtc.com), joins Ash Bennington, Real Vision senior editor, to discuss #Bitcoin custody solutions, growing interest in Bitcoin from traditional investors, and the global debt bubble. As central banks worldwide are engaging in loose monetary policy in an attempt to blunt the economic effects of the pandemic, Leibowitz shares that many of his clients understand the global macro story—as a result, people are increasingly interested in Bitcoin. In an era of historically low bond rates, he reiterates how this has spurred many investors to reallocate their portfolios in new assets as they are pushed out the risk curve seeking yield. Leibowitz explains the importance of self-custody of Bitcoin, but recognizes the difficulty of onboarding new people who are unfamiliar with how the new technology works. With the global debt bubble growing from drastic QE efforts and concerns over increasing debt on the Fed’s balance sheet, Leibowitz says that holding dollars in your portfolio, especially for corporate treasurers, is like holding a melting ice cube. Filmed on March 11, 2021.

Key Learnings: Traditional investors are becoming more attracted to assets such as Bitcoin as the global debt bubble grows, central banks continue to engage in quantitative easing and suppress rates, and currency debasement risk increases. Self-custody of Bitcoin is important to reduce custodian risks and costs, but can be difficult for people new to the technology.

Over the years, from Mt Gox to 2021, there is always a story of somebody trying to recover a lost hard drive from the city dump or sending large sums to the wrong address.

I want to hear your story. Not someone you know, or your friends cousins uncle, YOUR STORY. What would you have done differently. How can someone avoid what happened to you?",Bitcoin

t3_m7qn4o,Portfolio app?,"Anyone know of a good app that I can track different assets?   I have BTC obviously,  and several alt coins,   a few stocks,  and some gold and silver.   I'm looking for something that would have the updated prices of everything,  and show your percentages of each, and a graph of what your gaining and losing.   I dont need it to include every asset under the sun,  but something that at least has stable coins,  gold &amp; silver,  and major stock companies.  
Thanks",Bitcoin
